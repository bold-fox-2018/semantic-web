          <h2>What’s Markdown?</h2>
          <p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.</p>
          <p>Using Markdown is different than using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.</p>

          <h2>What’s Markdown Good For?</h2>
          <p>Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents.</p>
          <p>It doesn’t take long to learn the Markdown syntax, and once you know how to use it, you can write using Markdown just about everywhere. Most people use Markdown to create content for the web, but Markdown is good for formatting everything from email messages to grocery lists.</p>
          <p>Here are some examples of what you can do with Markdown.</p>

          <h3>Websites</h3>
          <p>Markdown was designed for the web, so it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of applications specifically designed for creating website content.</p>
          <p>If you’re looking for the simplest possible way to create a website with Markdown files, check out blot.im and smallvictori.es. After you sign up for one of these services, they create a Dropbox folder on your computer. Just drag and drop your Markdown files into the folder and — poof! — they’re on your website. It couldn’t be easier.</p>
          <p>If you’re familiar with HTML, CSS, and version control, check out Jekyll, a popular static site generator that takes Markdown files and builds an HTML website. One advantage to this approach is that GitHub Pages provides free hosting for Jekyll-generated websites. If Jekyll isn’t your cup of tea, just pick one of the many other static site generators available.</p>

          <h3>Documents</h3>
          <p>Markdown doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of word processors like Microsoft Word, but it’s good enough for creating basic documents like assignments and letters. You can use a Markdown document authoring application to create and export Markdown-formatted documents to PDF or HTML file format. The PDF part is key, because once you have a PDF document, you can do anything with it — print it, email it, or upload it to a website.</p>

          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <p>In nearly every way, Markdown is the ideal syntax for taking notes. Sadly, Evernote and OneNote, two of the most popular note applications, don’t currently support Markdown. The good news is that several other note applications do support Markdown</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simplenote is a free, barebones note-taking application available for every platform.</li>
            <li>Bear is an Evernote-like application available for Mac and iOS devices. It doesn’t exclusively use Markdown syntax by default, but you can enable Markdown compatibility mode.</li>
            <li>Boostnote bills itself as an “open source note-taking app designed for programmers.”</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Documentation</h3>
          <p>Markdown is a natural fit for technical documentation. Companies like GitHub are increasingly switching to Markdown for their documentation — check out their blog post about how they migrated their Markdown-formatted documentation to Jekyll.</p>
